          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Since a young age iâ€™ve always loved being creative. As a child, I would paint landscapes using acrylics with my grandmother. After high school, I decided that I wanted to try and make a career with my art, so I started the Graphic Design course at Algonquin College.</p>
          <p>I have an energetic five-year-old son named August, and a four-year-old black cat named Gotham. My interests include video games, horror movies, Marvel and DC, and Star Wars.</p>
